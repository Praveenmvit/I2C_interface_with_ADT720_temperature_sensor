# I2C_interface_with_ADT7420_temperature_sensor  
**ABOUT ADT7420:**
The ADT7420 is a high accuracy digital temperature sensor offering breakthrough performance over a wide industrial range, housed in a 4 mm × 4 mm LFCSP package. It contains an internal band gap reference, a temperature sensor, and a 16-bit ADC to monitor and digitize the temperature to 0.0078°C resolution. The ADC resolution, by default, is set to 13 bits (0.0625°C). The ADC resolution is a user programmable mode that can be changed through the serial interface.
